<h2>Some General Points</h2>
<h3>Note: For each input.txt files....Restart the Shell as it is the website fault that it doesn't clear the previous output.</h3>
<h4>1. If Leave x is the command and if xth slot is already emptied...Then I'm printing that- <br/> Already Empty....So not valid situation </h4>

<h4>2. If Parking lot is full, Then I'm printing that- <br/> Parking Full. Not Executing this command.....Moving to Next Command </h4>

<h4>3. If there are no slots or no vnr numbers to display for a particular command. Then I'm printing the empty line</h4>
